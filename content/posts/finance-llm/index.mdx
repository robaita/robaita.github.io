## Overview
💡I was recently working on an LLM assignment, the problem statement was to train one of the LLM models on Financial data (mostly tables) to seek answers of the mathematical questions. 🧠

I came across a research paper and discovered that LLMs are good in language pattern matching. But when it comes to imitation of complex reasoning abilities like human beings, their performance suffers. 

📊With this intent, I used FinQA dataset[^1] (Question Answering on Financial Report) to conduct experiment around that. I compared few of the results of BERT model trained on FinQA with ChatGPT. Results can be seen in the video 🤖

🔍Given a tricky scenario where I ask the question and given partial table to ChatGPT to answer, the finding was interesting.📉

For code and experiment you can visit the Github repository
