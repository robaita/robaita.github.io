## Overview
STAR methodoloy is an approach about how you can structure your responces [^1]. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action and Results. While making your responce, you can break the responce into four segments and then make a story around them. This would give a complete idea about in what situation, what problem you faced and how you overcome that by making a solution and at the end how the solution held you to get our from that situation. [^2] <br/>
STAR is used mainly in the behavioural interview but I believe that it could be used for the technical interviews as well [^3]. As it would give the complte idea about your work and descibe your role and contributions.
